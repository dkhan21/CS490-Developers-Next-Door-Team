Code Translation and Conversion Tool: Build a code translation tool that converts code between programming languages, with GPT-3 assisting in the translation process and ensuring code correctness

## Redwood Repo
Our project is built with **Redwood**, a full-stack framework.

Our Redwood Repository will be organized into two parts:
- the Api
- the Web

The **api** will contain the backend logic of our application. It defines the GraphQL schema, the Prisma models (map tables to our database), the services, and the functions.
The **web** will contain the frontend logic of our application. It defines the React components that render the user interface. It also defines the pages that correspond with the routes of our application. Additionally, it will include the pages, layout, and the routes.
The api and the web will communicate with each other through GraphQL.

 
## Our Tech Stack 
- Frontend Framework and Language - **React**
- Component Library - **Tailwind**
- API - **GraphQL**
- Backend Language - **Node.js**
-  Database - **SQLite**
-  Authentication Model - **dbAuth** (included in Redwood)
- Unit Test Frameworks - **Jest**
